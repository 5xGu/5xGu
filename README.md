# Superassistent
The superassistent is meant to be an app which assists the user in everyway they want to. It is foremost meant to be a planer for planers, but with hefty features, that make it super.
It is supposed to become an adroid application to begin with.
For example, if you want to keep track and plan health related stuff, then the superassistent is supposed to serve as a kind of organiser for this. So, for example, you
could create a nutrition plan, fitness plan and sleep plan. Lets say the nutrition plan included a goal for proteins, vitamins, etc. and also a daily drinking goal. The fitness plan 
consists of a training plan for weightlifting and one for running. Both again are structured, e.g. by the type of weightlifting you want to focus, lets say upper body, and the 
duration and number of runs you want to have weekly. Lastly, the sleeping plan simply tracks the time you go to bed, you wake up, and your perceived quality of sleep.

One goal is to have the superassissent help you be more consistent with your plans. That means, you set up certain goals, and the superassisstent tries to organise an estimated time
(also ofc settable, but maybe also learnable, if beginning and end time are set) frame in which you reach that goal. Lets say for example, you want to have a certain protein goal,
and decided to cook lentil lasagne to reach it for that day. The idea is for the Superassisstent to know this, e.g. by making the suggesstion for you in the first place. However,
it also knows that you want to have a good training before that, but also that you should eat around 18 O clock, because it learned in the past that if you eat later, you will sleep
worse. It should then give you an organisation for the day, which allows you to reach your goals. It should resolve conflicts based on a previously introduced (or learned) priority weighting.
This part might be more intuitive if you think of being a student, having appointments, or working, etc., where maybe a lot of scheduling conflicts appear easier, and it can be
difficult to reconcile them, while also recognizing the importance of sticking to our goals. For example, instead of skipping the workout, and then being late for dinner and eating
a faster prepared dinner, but which fails your goals, the Superassisstent could advice you to not start some process at your work, and finish early, but then move the project you need to
do to the following day, or two days later, etc. If that appointment is necessary however, and you cannot leave earlier, then the assisstent will propose a rescheduling of the
workout, and if necessary of the lasagna, and instead suggest some other source of protein to keep up with that goal, or maybe reschedule your training plan (if it makes sense in the
context of the plan) to change to lower body instead of upper, if it has been shown that you need (in some sense significant) less time for this plan.

The second goal is to have the Superassisstent give you a good overview or detailed data for your plans and goals, depending on your needs. This shall be achieved, is the idea rn, by
setting up metrics in the definition of the goals, by which they can be measured. There are different layers for this that are organised in a hierarchy. For example, the fitness plan
could consist of a workout and a running plan. The workoutplan could consist of a upper body, lower body, full body plan. The upper body plan could consist of the different exercises
you want to do. Lets say you want to track for every exercise how long you need to perform it, how much kg you manage and the number of repetitions for those kg. This is the lowest
level of the hierarchy. It does not get lower then the action we measure. And it is important the we measure an action here, as we usually schedule around what we do, not around what
happens.
This might not sound like much, but 'events' are not really important, because they are not really events. Lets say a doctors appointment is not an 'event' that just goes by, like the lunar
eclipse or the dawn of the sun. It involves you going to the doc, maybe preparing documents beforehand, waiting there, talking, maybe some examination, then you go home (or somewhere else).
So you can set up a measurement for a doctors appointment like this, by defining actions with metrics: (Ask for: 1 pacakge of painkillers, Ask for: (1) Blood examination, Bring: 2 Copies of 
Dentist Report) ... Now, a doctors appointment on its own might not be seem like something worth tracking this way, but if you put it into the broader context of a health plan,
then the 'event' becomes a measuarable action towards or in context of your health. Do I ask for painkillers everytime I am there? Are there patterns in my additional questions?
etc.
This is not meant to make you paranoid. The superassisstent is not meant to give you recommendations. It is only meant to track stuff you want to track. It is
supposed to empower and enable you to have data at your service and you to draw conclusions from. And it is supposed to be able to give you the data in an intuitively understandable
way, e.g. by graphical representations. A fitness plan could be represented by an animated graphical development. Recovery from illness could be represented by seeing a cloudpoint
representation of you quality of sleep, etc.

The main motivation for the superassisstent is learning to code, especially for android. Also, I want to support all of this by AI, especially organising being an intuitive case where
AI can learn your preferences, have some hard limits, etc. This is also something I want to learn. Lastly, the problem I want to solve is that of personalised data collection.
In my opinion there are two extremes for planners out there right now, and almost every planner I know falls into one of those categories. Either, the planner is not much more than a
fancy calender, fancy meaning often that it the calender is visually reworked, or even put into context of a gameification. Or, the planner is overloaded with features you do not need,
and most often makes use goals to set, to track, to rate, etc, without giving you a comprehensive and easy way to really evaluate your progress. Also, both types of planners are mostly
used to organise one or two metrics, for example time, or individual progress towards one goal (e.g. achieving a study goal).

The superassisstent, for all the unclarity still present, is supposed to be a framework for planners, i.e. a planner for planners, and assisst you in your life, depending on your
way of living and your desires. And it is supposed to not take ages to set up, by trying to track some basic data with the users help, going to a questionaire phase asking for confirmation
of the accuracy of its then automatically gathered data, and then finally going fully stealth in the background, until the user asks for it to come up again.

Another idea is to make the AI run offline, and have no cloud support or anything, to make it all run on the users device, be stored there, and no where else, etc. Maybe I will try to
make it completely offline too, at least if the user so desires.

Document upload/linking with plans shall also be allowed.
